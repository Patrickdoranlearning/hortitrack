## Primary Mission

Update STATUS.md so the next session can pick up exactly where this one left off.

## Process

1. Review the current conversation and changes made
2. Identify the key accomplishments
3. Note any blockers or issues encountered
4. List clear next steps in priority order
5. Update STATUS.md with this information

## Sections to Update

### Last Session Summary
- Date (today's date)
- What was the focus?
- What key changes were made?

### Active Blockers
- What's preventing progress?

### Next Steps

## Output

After updating STATUS.md:

```
✅ Session synced

Completed:
- [list accomplishments]

Next session should:
1. [top priority]
